# Infrastructure Automation #


Infrastructure automation is the process of reducing human interaction with IT systems by creating scripts or functions that are repeatable and can be used either by other software or on command.

IT infrastructure automation tools can control IT elements including servers, storage, network elements, and operating systems (OS), with the goal of improving efficiency of IT operations and staff, with the goal of hands-off operation in most environments including both cloud and on-premises elements of hybrid IT environments.
